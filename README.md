# NodeMCU-HallEffectSensor

NodeMCU with an AH180 Hall Effect Sensor transmitting data to the [readiness.io](https://readiness.io/) service

The Hall Effect Sensor that we've used essentially behaves like a switch. When a magnet is detected it closes the switch. So you can change the sensor to another switch, like a reed switch or push button and the code will continue to work.

We've put together a range of instructables showing how you can use the sensor for a range of different applications.

2. [A Rain Gauge](XXXXX)
3. [A Water Level Sensor](XXXXX)
